                              <time class="subtitle"> Bahrain is an Arab nation located in a bay on the Arabian Gulf's western shore.
                                Bahrain Island and about 30 smaller islands make up the archipelago.Bahrain, though situated in one of the world's major oil-producing regions, only has modest petroleum supplies on hand. Instead, its economy has long been dependent on refining crude oil from nearby nations.
                                More recently, however, the financial, commercial services, and communications industries have experienced significant growth, as has tourism. <time>
